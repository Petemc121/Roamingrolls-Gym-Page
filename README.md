# Roamingrolls-Gym-Page
An editable gym profile page for a jiujitsu gym database website I'm building. This page contains functionality such as appendable blocks of HTML to the page, inputs, sliders (that display in the center of the page dynamically upon clicking), and an interactive header with a sliding side bar and pop up sign up form. 

I'm in the process of integrating PHP and mySQL into the page to bind it to profile accounts in the database.
